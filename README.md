## What's this?
An operating system written in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org),
aiming to do more than echoing the keyboard to the screen ;)

## What can it do right now?
Nothing. At all. (this is quite ironic, given the previous statement)

## What do you plan to do with it?
See [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/ArchimedesPi/lossy/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)

## How can I help?
Find something to do (the [issues](https://github.com/ArchimedesPi/lossy/issues) will help with that),
fix it, and submit a PR. Oh, by the way, you might want to read about [hacking on Lossy](#hacking-on-the-code)

## Hacking on the code
Bring it up with Vagrant: `vagrant up`.
